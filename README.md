# Recipe_datatable_project
From my PHP/SQL class final project. Lets users input recipe info into a table and keep it and access it whenever.

It has a user login and user only page that gives access to the recipe input table and the recipe table that shows you what is in it.
I would like to finish this or atleast keep working on it to keep my skills up. I feel like this could be a good product to ship since it seems like theres not alot of websites or such
to share recipies. Or atleast keep a database of your recipes. 
One notable issue with my project though is that every person who logs in all inputs data into one table and everyone can see that. i would like that to be a feature but for logging in to your account it would be preferable to only see what youve inputed into your table.
I dont have the knowledge or skills to do that so that is the main thing i would like to learn how to fix.
